# PassMate: Your Security Companion
Hey! Welcome to **PassMate**, your versatile console tool designed to empower your digital security. It's a dual-purpose application that lets you effortlessly generate strong, random passwords or engage in a fun, challenging game to build them step-by-step.

## What's PassMate About?
At its heart, PassMate is about putting password power in your hands. Need a quick, super-secure password for a new account? PassMate's got you covered. Want to understand what makes a password truly strong while having a bit of fun? Dive into the **PassBuilt Game** where the rules get progressively tougher!

## What It Does:
**Password Generation:** Instantly create passwords of different types (**Numeric**, **Alphabetic**, **Alphanumeric**, **Complex**, **Passphrases**). You specify the desired length, and PassMate provides a randomized suggestion you can accept or regenerate.
**Play PassBuilt Game:** Challenge yourself across 7 progressive levels. Each level introduces new security rules. You submit a password, and if it meets *all* the current rules, you advance. If not, the game ends!
**Console-Friendly:** Designed for clear, simple text-based interaction, guiding you through options and feedback with ease.
